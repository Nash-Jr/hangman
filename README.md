# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This implements the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I am doing this task to put my OOP skills to the test. I have tried to minimise the amount of help I can use and trying to do it all from scratch.
